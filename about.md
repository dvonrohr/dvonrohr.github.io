My name is Daniel von Rohr. I'm a full-stack web developer and work for <a href="http://www.frontal.ch" target="_blank">Agency Frontal</a> in Willisau.

I love working with new web technologies and have experience with Pimcore, TYPO3, PHP, Python, Golang, JS 5/6 and much more. Especially I love coding with react.

On my way to try out new things, I have created this blog. Here I would like to discuss it with other users and look at it more closely.
